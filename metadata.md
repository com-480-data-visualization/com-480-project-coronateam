Extra ideas: The first extra idea would be to change the correlation plot design by implementing a solar correlation plot with the number of death from Covid-19 at the centre. An example of such a graph is presented below (right figure) (source: OReilly). Investigate the correlation with other variables which could be correlated with the Covid-19 prevalence, for example the number of frontiers by country and the relative score of restricted measures in place to stop the propagation. For this last one, as the number of countries included in our analysis is relatively small, we could estimate a score manually by looking at newspapers (for example, Switzerland would have a lower score than France).
