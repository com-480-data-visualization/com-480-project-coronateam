## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### Dataset
Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.

Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets (Google dataset search, Kaggle, OpenSwissData, SNAP and FiveThirtyEight)

 - Hopkins University Repo for Coronavirus: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
 - Gtrend python api:
 - Twitter api: + dataset twitter (https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs)

### Problematic
Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.

 - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
 - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
The main objective of the project is to study the geographical correlation between the Coronavirus and different types of information systems. 
In order to see if there is a correlation with the number of tweets talking about it and the number of Google searches, we first plotted these figures 
for 4 European countries that were affected early by the coronavirus.

So we will blablabla

### Related Work
 - What others have already done with the data?
 - Why is your approach original?
 - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
 - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

There has already been quite some work on the recent Coronavirus pandemic. The most notable is probably the one on the genetic evolutions of the virus' mutations by the Nextstrain team (https://nextstrain.org/ncov). Some journals have already published some simple infographics such as https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest and https://labs.letemps.ch/interactive/2020/carte-coronavirus-monde.

Original approach: ???

Inspiration: cartogram ?

 François Quellec has previously worked on an [article](https://github.com/labsletemps/coronavirus-trends) that has been published on the swiss magazine "Le Temps" using the Johns-Hopkins dataset, Google Trends, LinkAlong and the Twitter API. We may reuse the same datasets (especially the Johns-Hopkins) but our visualization will be different and we aim at representing all Europe (and the entire world if the data allows us).
